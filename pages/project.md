Project summary
===============
This document describes the compiler project that you will do as the main part
of the examination for the Compiler Construction course. The project is done
individually or in groups of two students (recommended). The project is split
into three parts:

1. Front end for the language \$javalette\$, i.e. lexical analysis, parsing,
   building abstract syntax, type-checking and a few static checks. This part
   builds mainly on knowledge that you should have acquired previously, e.g. in
   the course Programming Language Technology.
2. A back end that generates code for LLVM (the Low Level Virtual Machine). LLVM
   are described in more detail [later in this page](#code_generation).
3. [Extensions](#extensions) to the base language. There are several optional
   extensions that you may choose to do for the third part of the project, as
   detailed below.


<a name="deadlines"></a>

Submission deadlines
--------------------

There are three submission deadlines, one for each part of the project:

* **Submission A**: \$deadline1\$. At this point you must submit part 1,
    i.e. a working compiler that can parse and typecheck all programs in the
    base language and statically reject illegal programs.
* **Submission B**: \$deadline2\$. Part 2, i.e., a complete compiler
    that can compile and run all programs in the base language.
* **Submission C**: \$deadline3\$. Part 3. At least one extension to the base
    language is required to pass the course. More [extensions](#extensions) can be
    implemented to get a higher grade. More information [below](#grading).

In addition to these submissions, examination includes a brief oral exam after
submission C. Exact dates will be posted on this course homepage.


<a name="grading"></a>

Extensions, credits and grades
------------------------------

The options for extending the project are to extend the source language with
e.g.  arrays and `for`-loops, structures and pointers, object-oriented features
or to generate native x86 code. There is also one essay project you can do which
involves studying optimizations in the LLVM framework. You do not need to decide
in advance how ambitious you want to be; instead you should finish each stage
before you attempt an extension.

In submission C, each of the seven tasks described in the
"[extensions](#extensions)" section gives one credit if implemented as
described, with the exception of [x86 code generation](#x86).  Implementing a
code generator gives *two* credits, but also requires you to implement some
optimization for your code generator, such as register allocation or peephole
optimization.

*To pass the course* and get grade 3 (or G, if you are a GU student), you need
to submit working solutions in *all submissions*, implement at least *one
language extension* in submission C, and pass the *oral exam*. To get grade 4,
you must earn three credits; grade 5 (VG for GU students) requires five credits.

If you are only looking to pass the course and only get one credit then the
project extension of [studying an LLVM optimization](#optstudy) is not enough.
You must implement at least one language extension to Javalette in order to pass
the course.

Part of the goal of a project course, like this course, is that you shall
deliver working code *on time*. Thus, credits will be awarded for working
extensions submitted before the deadline. We may allow resubmissions for minor
bugfixes, but no partial credits will be awarded for partial solutions.

Finally, we note that we are making major simplifications in a compiler project
by using virtual machines like LLVM as targets, rather than a real machine. This
means that you can produce simple-minded code and rely on the respective target
tools to do optimization and JIT compilation to machine code.  The final
lectures in the course will discuss these issues, but they will not be covered
in depth. On the other hand, for most compiling purposes the road we take is the
most effective. This leaves fine-tuning of optimization to LLVM tools, allowing
many source languages and front-ends to profit from this effort.


Collaboration and academic honesty
----------------------------------

As mentioned before, you work individually or in groups of two to three in this
project. You must develop your own code, and you are *not* allowed to share your
code with other students or to get, or even look at, code developed by them. On
the other hand, we encourage discussions among participants in the course about
the project. As long as you follow the simple and absolute rule not to share
code, we have no objections to questions asked and answered at a conceptual
level. 

If you do get significant help from some other participant, it is natural to
acknowledge this in your documentation file.

Don't be a cheater.


<a name="javalette"></a>

The language Javalette
======================

Javalette is a simple imperative language. It is almost a subset of C
(see below). It can also be easily translated to Java (see below).

Javalette is not a realistic language for production use. However, it is big
enough to allow for a core compiler project that illustrates all phases in
compilation. It also forms a basis for extensions in several directions.

The basic language has no heap-allocated data. However, the extensions involve
(Java-like) arrays, structures and objects, all of which are allocated on the
heap. The extended language is designed to be garbage-collected, but you will
not implement garbage collection as part of your project. 

The description in this document is intentionally a bit vague and based on
examples; it is part of your task to define the language precisely.  However,
the language is also partly defined by a collection of test programs (see
below), on which the behaviour of your compiler is specified.


<a name="example_programs"></a>

Some small Javalette programs
-----------------------------

Let's start with a couple of small programs. First, here is how to say hello to
the world:

```java
// Hello world program

int main () {
  printString("Hello world!") ;
  return 0 ;
}
```

A program that prints the even numbers smaller than 10 is

```java
int main () {
  int i = 0 ;
  while (i < 10) {
    if (i % 2 == 0) printInt(i) ; 
    i++ ;
  } 
  return 0 ;
}
```

Finally, we show the factorial function in both iterative and recursive style:

```java
int main () {
  printInt(fact(7)) ;
  printInt(factr(7)) ;
  return 0 ;
} 

// iterative factorial

int fact (int n) {
  int i,r ;
  i = 1 ;
  r = 1 ;
  while (i <= n) {
    r = r * i ;
    i++ ;
  }
  return r ;
} 

// recursive factorial

int factr (int n) {
  if (n < 2) 
    return 1 ;
  else 
    return n * factr(n-1) ; 
} 
```

<a name="structure"></a>

Program structure
-----------------

A Javalette program is a sequence of *function definitions*.

A function definition has a *return type*, a *name*, a *parameter list*, and a
*body* consisting of a *block*.

The names of the functions defined in a program must be different (i.e, there is
no overloading). 

One function must have the name `main`. Its return type must be `int` and its
parameter list empty. Execution of a program consists of executing `main`.

A function whose return type is not `void` *must* return a value of its return
type. The compiler must check that it is not possible that execution of the
function terminates without passing a `return` statement. This check may be
conservative, i.e. reject as incorrect certain functions that actually would
always return a value.  A typical case could be to reject a function ending with
an `if`-statement where only one branch returns, without considering the
possibility that the test expression might always evaluate to the same value,
avoiding the branch without `return`. However, your check must correctly decide
the control flow when the test expression is the literal `true` or the literal
`false`.  A function, whose return type is `void`, may, on the other hand, omit
the `return` statement completely.

Functions can be *mutually recursive*, i.e., call each other. There is no
prescribed order between function definitions (i.e., a call to a function may
appear in the program before the function definition).

There are no modules or other separate compilation facilities; we consider only
one-file programs.


<a name="types"></a>

Types
-----

Basic Javalette types are `int`, `double`, `boolean` and `void`.  Values of
types `int`, `double` and `boolean` are denoted by literals (see below). `void`
has no values and no literals.

No coercions (casts) are performed between types. Note this: it is NOT
considered an improvement to your compiler to add implicit casts. In fact, some
of the test programs check that you do not allow casts.

In the type checker, it is useful to have a notion of a *function type*, which
is a pair consisting of the value type and the list of parameter types.


<a name="statements"></a>

Statements
----------

The following are the forms of statements in Javalette; we indicate syntax using
BNFC notation, where we use `Ident`, `Exp` and `Stmt` to indicate a variable,
expression and statement, respectively. Terminals are given within quotes. For
simplicity, we sometimes deviate here from the actual provided [grammar
file](/files/Javalette.cf).

* *Empty statement*: `";"`
* *Variable declarations*: `Type Ident ";"`
    
    Comment: Several variables may be declared simultaneously, as in
    `int i, j;` and initial values may be specified, as in
    `int n = 0;`
* *Assignments*: `Ident "=" Exp ";"`
* *Increments and decrements*: `Ident "++" ";"` and `Ident "--" ";"`
    
    Comment: Only for variables of type `int`; can be seen as sugar for assignments.
* *Conditionals*:  `"if" "(" Exp ")" Stmt "else" Stmt`
    
    Comment: Can be without the `else` part.
* *While loops* : `"while" "(" Exp ")" Stmt`
* *Returns*: `"return" Exp ";"`
    
    Comment: No `Exp` for type `void`.
* *Expressions of type* `void`: `Exp ";"`
    
    Comment: The expression here will be a call to a void function (no other
    expressions have type `void`).
* *Blocks*: `"{" [Stmt] "}"`
    
    Comment: A function body is a statement of this form.

Declarations may appear anywhere within a block, but a variable must be declared
before it is used. 

A variable declared in an outer scope may be redeclared in a block; the new
declaration then shadows the previous declaration for the rest of the block.

A variable can only be declared once in a block.

If no initial value is given in a variable declaration, the value of the
variable is initialized to `0` for type `int`, `0.0` for type `double` and
`false` for type `boolean`.  Note that this is different from Java, where local
variables must be explicitly initialized.


<a name="expressions"></a>

Expressions
-----------

Expressions in Javalette have the following forms:

* *Literals*: Integer, double, and Boolean literals (see below).
* *Variables*.
* *Binary operators*: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` and
    `%`. Types are as expected; all except `%` are
    overloaded. Precedence and associativity as in C and Java.
* *Relational expressions*: `==`, `!=`,
    `<`, `<=`, `>` and `>=`. All overloaded
    as expected.
* *Disjunctions and conjunctions*: `||` and `&&`.
    These operators have *lazy semantics*, i.e.,
    
    * In `a && b`, if `a` evaluates to `false`,
        `b` is not evaluated and the value of the whole expression is `false`.
    * In `a || b`, if `a` evaluates to `true`,
        `b` is not evaluated and the value of the whole expression is `true`.
* *Unary operators*: `-` and `!`
    (negation of `int` and `double`, negation of `boolean`).
* Function calls.


<a name="lexical_details"></a>

Lexical details
---------------

Some of the tokens in Javalette are

* *Integer literals*: sequence of digits, e.g. `123`.
* *Float (double) literals*: digits with a decimal point, e.g. `3.14`,
possibly with an exponent (positive or negative), e.g. `1.6e-48`.
* *Boolean literals*:  `true` and `false`.
* *String literals*: ASCII characters in double quotes, e.g. `"Hello world"`
(escapes as usual: \verb#\n \t \" \\#). Can only be used in calls of
primitive function `printString`.
* *Identifiers*: a letter followed by an optional 
sequence of letters, digits, and underscores.
* *Reserved words*: These include `while`,
  `if`, `else` and `return`. 

Comments in Javalette are enclosed between `/\*` and `\*/` or extend from `//`
to the end of line, or from `#` to the end of line (to treat C preprocessor
directives as comments).


<a name="primitive_functions"></a>

Primitive functions
-------------------

For input and output, Javalette programs may use the following functions:

```java
void printInt (int n)
void printDouble (double x)
void printString (String s)
int readInt ()
double readDouble ()
```

Note that there are no variables of type string in Javalette, so the only
argument that can be given to `printString` is a string literal.

The print functions print their arguments terminated by newline and the read
functions will only read one number per line. This is obviously rudimentary, but
enough for our purposes.

These functions are not directly implemented in the virtual machines we use. We
will provide them using other means, as detailed [below](#code_generation).


<a name="parameter_passing"></a>

Parameter passing
-----------------

All parameters are passed by value, i.e., the value of the actual parameter is
computed and copied into the formal parameter before the subroutine is executed.
Parameters act as local variables within the subroutine, i.e., they can be
assigned to.


<a name="javalette_c_and_java"></a>

Javalette, C and Java
----------------------

\label{sec:c-java}

Javalette programs can be compiled by a C compiler (`gcc`) if prefixed by
suitable preprocessor directives and macro definitions, e.g.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#define printInt(k) printf("%d\n", k)
#define boolean int
#define true 1
```

In addition, function definitions must be reordered so that definition precedes
use, mutual recursion must be resolved by extra type signatures and variable
declarations moved to the beginnings of blocks.

Javalette programs can be compiled by a Java compiler (`javac`) by wrapping all
functions in a class as `public static` methods and adding one more `main`
method that calls your `main`:

```java
public static void main (String[] args) {
  main();
}
```

Using a C compiler or Java compiler is a good way to understand what a program
means even before you have written the full compiler. It can be useful to test
the programs produced by your compiler with the result of the C- and/or Java
compiler.


<a name="frontend"></a>

The front end
=============

Your first task is to implement a compiler front end for Javalette:

1. Define suitable data types/classes for representing Javalette abstract
   syntax.
2. Implement a lexer and parser that builds abstract syntax from strings.
3. Implement a type checker that checks that programs are type-correct.
4. Implement a main program that calls lexer, parser and type checker, and
   reports errors.

These tasks are very well understood; there is a well-developed theory and, for
steps 1 and 2, convenient tools exist that do most of the work. You should be
familiar with these theories and tools and we expect you to complete the front
end during the first week of the course.

We recommend that you use the BNF converter and either Alex and Happy (if you
decide to implement your compiler in Haskell) or JLex and Cup (if you use Java).
We may also allow other implementation languages and tools, but we can not
guarantee support, and you must discuss your choice with \$teacher\$ before you
start. This is to make sure that we will be able to run your compiler and that
you will not use inferior tools.

We provide a BNFC source file [`Javalette.cf`](/files/Javalette.cf) that you may
use. If you already have a BNFC file for a similar language that you want to
reuse you may do so, but you must make sure that you modify it to pass the test
suite for this course.

We will accept a small number of shift/reduce conflicts in your parser; your
documentation must describe these and argue that they are harmless.
Reduce/reduce conflicts are not allowed. The provided BNFC file has the standard
dangling-else shift/reduce conflict.

One thing to note is that it may be useful to implement the type-checker as a
function, which traverses the syntax *and returns its input* if the program is
type-correct.  The reason for this is that you may actually want to modify this
and decorate the syntax trees with more information during type-checking for
later use by the code generator. One example of such decoration can be to
annotate all subexpressions with type information; this will be useful during
code generation.

To do this, you can add one further form of expression to your BNFC source,
namely a type-annotated expression. 


<a name="extensions"></a>

Extensions
==========

This section describes optional extensions that you may implement to learn more,
get credits and thus a higher final grade. You may choose different combinations
of the extensions.

In this section we specify the requirements on the extensions. Some
implementation hints are given in section [extension hints](#extension_hints)
and in the lecture notes.


<a name="arrays1"></a>

One-dimensional arrays and for loops
------------------------------------

The basic Javalette language has no heap-allocated data, so memory management
consists only of managing the run-time stack. In this extension you will add
one-dimensional arrays to basic Javalette. To get the credit, you must implement
this in the front end and in the respective back end.
 
Arrays are Java-like: variables of array type contain a reference to the actual
array, which is allocated on the heap. Arrays are explicitly created using a
`new` construct and variables of array type have an attribute, `length`, which
is accessed using dot notation.

Some examples of array declarations in the extension are

```java
int[] a ;
double[] b;
```

Creating an array may or may not be combined with the declaration:

```java
a = new int[20];
int[] c = new int[30];
```

After the above code, `a.length` evaluates to 20 and `a` refers to an array of
20 integer values, indexed from 0 to 19 (indexing always starts at 0). It is not 
required to generate bounds-checking code.

Functions may have arrays as arguments and return arrays as results:

```java
int[] sum (int[] a, int[] b) {
  int[] res = new int [a.length];
  int i = 0;
  while (i < a.length) {
    res[i] = a[i] + b[i];
    i++;
  }
  return res;
}
```

Array parameters are passed by value, that is the reference is copied into the
parameter.

One new form of expressions is added, namely indexing, as shown in the example.
Indexed expressions may also occur as L-values, i.e., as left hand sides of
assignment statements. An array can be filled with values by assigning each
individual element, as in function `sum`. But one can also assign references as
in C or Java:

```java
c = a;
```

\medskip

The extension also includes implementation of a simple form of `foreach`-loop to
iterate over arrays. If `expr` is an expression of type  `t[]`, the following
is a new form of statement:

```
for (t var : expr) stmt
```

The variable `var` of type `t` assumes the values `expr[0]`, `expr[1]` and so on
and the `stmt` is executed for each value. The scope of `var` is just `stmt`.

This form of loop is very convenient when you want to iterate over an array and
access the elements, but it is not useful when you need to assign values to the
elements. For this, we still have to rely on the `while` loop. The traditional
`for`-loop would be attractive here, but we cannot implement everything.

Test files for this extension are in subdirectory `extensions/arrays1`.


<a name="arrays2"></a>

Multidimensional arrays
-----------------------

In this extension you add arrays with an arbitrary number of indices.  Just as
in Java, an array of type `int[][]` is a one-dimensional array, each of whose
elements is a one-dimensional array of integers.  Declaration, creation and
indexing is as expected:

```java
int[][] matrix = new int[10][20];
int[][][] pixels;
...
matrix[i][j] =  2 * matrix[i][j];
```

You must specify the number of elements in each dimension when creating an
array. For a two-dimensional rectangular array such as `matrix`, the number of
elements in the two dimensions are `matrix.length` and `matrix[0].length`,
respectively.


<a name="pointers"></a>

Dynamic data structures
-----------------------

In this extension you will implement a simple form of dynamic data structures,
which is enough to implement lists and trees.  The source language extensions
are the following:

* Two new forms of top-level definitions are added (in the basic
    language there are only function definitions): 
    1. *Structure definitions*, as examplified by
        ```c
        struct Node {
           int elem; 
           list next; 
        };
        ````
    2. *Pointer type definitions*, as examplified by 
        ```c
        typedef struct Node *list; 
        ```
        Note that this second form is intended to be very restricted. We can
        only use it to introduce new types that represent pointers to
        structures. Thus this form of definition is completely fixed except for
        the names of the structure and the new type. Note also that, following
        the spirit of Javalette, the order of definitions is arbitrary.
* Three new forms of expression are introduced:
    1. *Heap object creation*, examplified by `new Node`,
        where `new` is a new reserved word.  A new block of heap
        memory is allocated and the expression returns a pointer to that
        memory. The type of this expression is thus the type of pointers
        to `Node`, i.e. `list`. 
    2. *Pointer dereferencing*,
        examplified by `xs->next`. This returns the content of the
        field `next` of the heap node pointed to by `xs`.
    3. *Null pointers*, examplified by `(list)null`. Note that
        the pointer type must be explicitly mentioned here, using syntax
        similar to casts (remember that there are no casts in Javalette).
* Finally, pointer dereferencing may also be used as L-values and thus occur to
    the left of an assignment statement, as in
    ```c
    xs->elem = 3;
    ```

Here is an example of a complete program in the extended language:

```c
typedef struct Node *list;

struct Node {
  int elem;
  list next;
};


int main () {
  printInt (length (fromTo (1, 100)));
  return 0;
}

list cons (int x, list xs) {
  list n;
  n = new Node;
  n->elem = x;
  n->next = xs;
  return n;
}

list fromTo (int m, int n) {
  if (m>n)
    return (list)null;
  else 
    return cons (m, fromTo (m + 1, n));
}

int length (list xs) {
  int res = 0;
  while (xs != (list)null) {
    res++;
    xs = xs->next;
  }
  return res;
}
```

This and a few other test programs can be found in the `extensions/pointers`
subdirectory of the test suite. 


<a name="oop1"></a>

Object-orientation
------------------

This extension adds classes and objects to basic Javalette. From a language
design point of view, it is not clear that you would want both this and the
previous extension in the same language, but here we disregard this.

Here is a first simple program in the proposed extension:

```java
class Counter {
  int val;

  void incr () {
    val++; 
    return;
  }

  int value () {
    return val;
  }
}

int main () {
  Counter c;
  c = new Counter;
  c.incr ();
  c.incr ();
  c.incr ();
  int x = c.value ();
  printInt (x);
  return 0;
}
```

We define a class `Counter`, and in `main` create an object and call its methods
a couple of times. The program writes 3 to `stdout`.

The source language extensions, from basic Javalette, are

* A new form of top-level definition: a *class declaration*.
    A class has a number of instance variables and a number of methods. 
   
    Instance variables are private and are *only* visible within the methods of
    the class. We could not have written `c.val` in `main`. 
    
    All methods are public; there is no way to define private methods.  It would
    not be difficult in principle to allow this, but we must limit the task.
    
    There is always only one implicit constructor method in a class, with no
    arguments.  Instance variables are, as all variables in Javalette,
    initialized to default values: numbers to 0, booleans to false and object
    references to null.
    
    We support a simple form of single inheritance: a class may extend another
    one:
    
    ```java
    class Point2 {
      int x;
      int y;
    
      void move (int dx, int dy) {
         x = x + dx;
         y = y + dy;
      }
    
      int getX () { return x; }
    
      int getY () { return y; }
    }
    
    class Point3 extends Point2 {
      int z;
    
      void moveZ (int dz) {
        z = z + dz;
      }
    
      int getZ () { return z; }
    
    }
    
    int main () {
      Point2 p;
    
      Point3 q = new Point3;
    
      q.move (2,4);
      q.moveZ (7);
      p = q;
    
      p.move (3,5);
     
      printInt (p.getX());  
      printInt (p.getY());  
      printInt (q.getZ());  
    
      return 0;
    }
    ```
    
    Here `Point3` is a subclass of `Point2`. The program above prints 5, 9 and 7.
    
    Classes are types; we can declare variables to be (references to) objects of
    a certain class. Note that we have subtyping: we can do the assignment `p =
    q;`. The reverse assignment, `q = p;` would be a type error. We have a
    strong  restriction, though: we will *not* allow overriding of methods. Thus
    there is no need for dynamic dispatch; all method calls can be statically
    determined.
* There are four new forms of expression:
    
    1. `"new" Ident` creates a new object, with fields initialized as described
        above.
    2. `Expr "." Expr`, is a method call; the first expression must evaluate to
        an object reference and the second to a call of a method of that object.
    3. `"(" Ident ") null"` is the null reference of the indicated class/type.
    4. `"self"` is, within the methods of a class, a reference to the current
        object. All calls to other, sibling methods of the class must be
        indicated as such using `self`, as in `self.isEmpty()` from one of the
        test files. This requirement is natural, since the extended Javalette,
        in contrast to Java, has free functions that are not methods of any
        class.

Object orientation with dynamic dispatch
----------------------------------------

The restriction not to allow method override is of course severe. In this
extension the restriction is removed and subclassing with inheritance and method
override implemented. This requires a major change of implementation as compared
to the previous extension. It is no longer possible to decide statically which
code to run when a message is sent to an object. Thus, each object at runtime
must have a link to a class descriptor, a struct with pointers to the code of
the methods of the class. These class descriptor are linked together in a list,
where a class descriptor has a link to the descriptor of its superclass. This
list is searched at runtime for the proper method to execute. All this is
discussed more during the lectures.


<a name="x86"></a>

Native x86 code generation.
---------------------------

This extension is to produce native assembler code for a real machine,
preferrably x86. We may accept code generators for other architectures, but
*you* need to think of how we can test your extension. Before you attempt to
write a backend for another architecture, discuss your choice with \$teacher\$
and explain the testing procedure.

Note that this extension gives you *two* credits, but it is not enough to just
implement a naïve code generator. You must also implement some sort of
optimization, such as register allocation or peephole optimization. Talk to
\$teacher\$ about which optimization(s) to implement before attempting the x86
code generator. The x86 code generation extension acts also as a kind of 
multiplier, that is, implementing another extension, for example arrays, will 
give you two credits instead of one. This fair because you need to generate
code for both LLVM and x86.


<a name="optstudy"></a>

Study of LLVM optimization
--------------------------

We offer one possibility to get a credit that does not involve implementing a
Javalette extension. This is to do a more thorough study of the LLVM framework
and write a report of 4-5 pages. More precisely the task is as follows.

Look at the list of available optimization passes and choose at least three of
these for further study. Mail \$teacher\$ to agree that your choice is suitable
(do this *before* you start to work on the extension!).

For each pass you must:

* Describe the optimization briefly; what kind of analysis is involved, how is
  code transformed?
* Find a Javalette program that is suitable to illustrate the optimization. List
  the program, the LLVM code generated by your compiler and the LLVM code that
  results by using `opt` to apply this pass (and only this pass). In addition to
  the code listing, explain how the general description in the previous item
  will actually give the indicated result. Part of the task is to find a program
  where the pass has an interesting effect.

We emphasize again that if you are only looking to pass the course and only get
one credit then this project is not enough. You have to implement at least one
extension to Javalette in order to pass the course.


<a name="moreextensions"></a>

Further possibilities
---------------------

We are willing to give credits also to other extensions, which are not as well
defined. If you want to do one of these and get credit, you must discuss it with
\$teacher\$ in advance. Here are some possibilities:

* Allow functions to be statically nested.
* Implement higher order functions, using either closures or
  defunctionalization.
* A simple module system. Details on module systems will be provided in the
  lectures.
* Implement exceptions, which can be thrown and caught.
* Implement some form of garbage collection.
* Provide a predefined type of lists with list comprehensions, similar to what
  is available in Python.
* Implement a backend for another architecture, such as ARM. It is important
  that you provide some way for the grader to test programs.


<a name="testing"></a>

Testing the project
===================

Needless to say, you should test your project extensively. We provide a
[testsuite](/resources#testsuite) of programs and will run your compiler on
these. You can download the testsuite from the course web site and run it
locally or on a Chalmers machine (e.g., `remote11` or a Linux lab machine). The
testsuite contains both correct programs (in subdirectory `testsuite/good`) and
illegal programs (in subdirectory `testsuite/bad`). For the good programs the
correct output is provided in files with suffix `.output`. The bad programs
contain examples of both lexical, syntactical and type errors.

Already after having produced the parser you should therefore write a main
program and try to parse all the test programs. The same holds for the type
checker and so on. When you only have the parser, you will of course pass some
bad programs; those that are syntactically correct but have type errors.

Summarizing, your compiler must:

* accept and be able to compile all of the files `testsuite/good/*.jl`. For
  these files, the compiler must print a line containing only `OK` to  standard
  error, optionally followed by arbitrary output, such as a syntax tree or other
  messages. The compiler must then exit with  the exit code 0.
* reject all of the files in `testsuite/bad/*.jl`. For these files, the compiler
  must print  `ERROR` as the first line to standard error and then give an
  informative error message. The compiler must then exit with an exit code
  other than 0.

Furthermore, for correct programs, your compiled programs, must run and give
correct output. 


Automated testing
-----------------

Before submission you **must** run that program to verify that your compiler
behaves correctly. Our first action when we receive your submission is to run
these tests. If this run fails, we will reject your submission without further
checks, so you must make sure that this step works. Unfortunately, we cannot
supply a working test driver for the Windows platform. If you have a Windows
machine, you may do most of the development, including manual testing, on that
machine, but for final testing you should transfer your project to our lab (or
remote) machines and run the test driver.

The test driver runs each good program and compares its output with the
corresponding  `.output` file. If the program needs input, this is taken from
the `.input` file. Note that the test driver handles this; your generated code
should read from `stdin` and write to `stdout`.

The tests are of course not exhaustive. It is quite possible that the grader
will discover bugs in your code even if it passes all tests. 

[The tester](/resources#testsuite) is provided as a gzipped tar ball, which can
be downloaded from the course web site. You can use it to run the tests for your
project. This archive contains a test driver `Grade.hs` with supporting files,
and a subdirectory `testsuite` containing Javalette test programs. 


### Installation

The tester requires a Linux (or Mac OS X, or other Unix) environment and a
recent version of the [Haskell Platform](http://haskell.org/platform). If you
work on your own Windows machine, we cannot assist you in making the tester
work. You should anyhow download the tester to get access to the testsuite in
directory `testsuite`. Before submitting, you must upload your project to a
lab machines and verify the submission.


### Running the tests

Assume that your submission directory is `dir` and that your compiler is called
`jlc`. Assume also that `dir/lib` contains the runtime support file
(`runtime.bc` for submission B, and possibly `runtime.o` for submission C).

The test driver takes a number of options:

| Flag           | Effect                                                      |
|:---------------|:------------------------------------------------------------|
| `-s <name>`    | Name of your compiler binary                                |
| `-b <backend>` | Backend to use. One of `LLVM`, `x86`, `x86_64` and `custom` |
| `-l <ver>`     | LLVM version to use for with LLVM backend (only \$llvmversion\$ has guaranteed support).                  |
| `-x <ext>`     | Implemented extensions. May be given multiple times.        |
| `-t <dir>`     | Directory in which the Javalette test programs are found.   |
| `-k`           | Keep any temporary directories created by the tester.       |
| `-h`           | Print detailed help and usage instructions.                 |

In addition, it takes one mandatory argument: a directory or tarball in which to
find your submission.

Thus, if you have placed your submission directory, `dir`, in the directory
containing `Grade.hs`, you can test your compiler as follows:

```
runhaskell Grade.hs dir
```

The above command will compile all the basic Javalette programs. The tester will
*not* attempt to run the good programs, so this is suitable for testing your
compiler for submission A. Note that it is essential that your compiler writes
one line to `stderr`, containing `OK` for correct programs and `ERROR` for
incorrect programs.

To also *run* the good programs and test them for submission B:

```
runhaskell Grade.hs -b LLVM dir
```

The test driver will report its activities in compiling the test programs and
running the good ones. If your compiler is correct, output will end as follows:

```
Summary:
 0 Compiling core programs (101/101)
 0 Running core programs (35/35)

Credits total: 0
```

All 101 test programs were compiled and gave correct indication OK or ERROR to
stderr. The 35 correct programs were run and gave correct output. Note that the
actual numbers can be different, since we may add tests.

To test the extensions for submission, run the test suite with the `-x` flag
for each extension you have implemented. The following command will run the
tests for the two array extensions.

```
runghc Grade.hs -b LLVM -x arrays1 -x arrays2 dir
```

The following extensions are supported by the test suite: `arrays1`, `arrays2`,
`pointers`, `objects1`, `objects2`. If you have implemented the x86 code
generation extension, use `-b x86` (or `-b x86_64`) to run all tests using that
instead of the LLVM backend. If your x86 compiler has a different name than
`jlc`, don't forget to specify it using `-s <compiler>`.


<a name="code_generation"></a>

Code generation: LLVM
=====================

LLVM (Low Level Virtual Machine) is both an intermediate representation language
and a compiler infrastructure, i.e. a collection of software components for
manipulating (e.g. optimizing) LLVM code and backends for various architectures.
LLVM has a large user base and is actively developed. A lot of information and
code to download can be found at the LLVM web site `http://www.llvm.org`. You
must use the \$llvmversion$\ version in this course; the
[testsuite](/resources#testsuite) has only guaranteed support forthis particular 
version.

Also LLVM code comes in two formats, a human-readable assembler format (stored
in `.ll` files) and a binary bitcode format (stored in`.bc` files). Your
compiler will produce the assembler format and you will use the LLVM assembler
`llvm-as` to produce binary files for execution.

In addition to the assembler, the LLVM infrastructure consists of a large number
of tools for optimizing, linking, JIT-compiling and manipulating bitcode. One
consequence is that a compiler writer may produce very simple-minded LLVM code
and leave to the LLVM tools to improve code when needed. Of course, similar
remarks apply to JVM code.


LLVM code
---------

The LLVM virtual machine is a *register machine*, with an infinite supply of
typed, virtual registers. The LLVM intermediate language is a version of
*three-address code* with arithmetic instructions that take operands from two
registers and place the result in a third register. LLVM code must be in SSA
(static single assignment) form, i.e. each virtual register may only be assigned
once in the program text.

The LLVM language is typed, and all instructions contain type information. This
"high-level" information, together with the "low-level" nature of the virtual
machine, gives LLVM a distinctive flavour.

The LLVM web site provides a wealth of information, including language
references, tutorials, tool manuals etc. There will also be lectures focusing on
code generation for LLVM.


The structure of a LLVM file
----------------------------

There is less overhead in the LLVM file. But, since the language is typed, we
must inform the tools of the types of the primitive functions:

```llvm
declare void @printInt(i32)
declare void @printDouble(double)
declare void @printString(i8*)
declare i32 @readInt()
declare double @readDouble()
```

Here `i32` is the type of 32 bit integers and `i8*` is the type of a pointer to
an 8 bit integer (i.e., to a character). Note that function names in LLVM always
start with `@`.

Before running a compiled Javalette program, `myfile.bc` must be linked with
`runtime.bc`, a file implementing the primitive functions, which we will
provide. In fact, this file is produced by giving `clang` a simple C file with
definitions such as

```c
void printInt(int x) {
  printf("%d\n",x);
}
```


An example
----------

The following LLVM code demonstrates some of the language features in LLVM. It
also serves as an example of what kind of code a Javalette compiler could
generate for the `fact` function described [here](#example_programs). 

```llvm
define i32 @main() {
entry:  %t0 = call i32 @fact(i32 7)             ; function call
        call void @printInt(i32 %t0)
        ret  i32 0

}

define i32 @fact(i32 %__p__n) {
entry:  %n = alloca i32                         ; allocate a variable on stack
        store i32 %__p__n , i32* %n             ; store parameter
        %i = alloca i32
        %r = alloca i32
        store i32 1 , i32* %i                   ; store initial values
        store i32 1 , i32* %r
        br label %lab0                          ; branch to lab0

lab0:   %t0 = load i32* %i                      ; load i
        %t1 = load i32* %n                      ; and n
        %t2 = icmp sle i32 %t0 , %t1            ; boolean %t2 will hold i <= n
        br i1 %t2 , label %lab1 , label %lab2   ; branch depending on %t2

lab1:   %t3 = load i32* %r               
        %t4 = load i32* %i
        %t5 = mul i32 %t3 , %t4                 ; compute i * r
        store i32 %t5 , i32* %r                 ; store product
        %t6 = load i32* %i                      ; fetch i,
        %t7 = add i32 %t6 , 1                   ; add 1
        store i32 %t7 , i32* %i                 ; and store
        br label %lab0

lab2:   %t8 = load i32* %r
        ret  i32 %t8

}
```

We note several things:

* Registers and local variables have names starting with `%`.
* The syntax for function calls uses conventional parameter lists (with type
  info for each parameter).
* Booleans have type `i1`, one bit integers.
* After initialization, we branch explicitly to `lab0`, rather than just falling
  through.


LLVM tools
----------

Your compiler will generate a text file with LLVM code, which is conventionally
stored in files with suffix `.ll`. There are then several tools you might use:

* The *assembler* `llvm-as`, which translates the file to an equivalent binary
  format, called the *bitcode* format, stored in files with suffix `.bc` This is
  just a more efficient form for further processing. There is a *disassembler*
  `llvm-dis` that translates in the opposite direction.
* The *linker* `llvm-link`, which can be used to link together, e.g., `main.bc`
  with the bitcode file `runtime.bc` that defines the function `@printInt` and
  the other `IO` functions. By default, two files are written, `a.out` and
  `a.out.bc`.  As one can guess from the suffix, `a.out.bc` is a bitcode file
  which contains the definitions from all the input bitcode files.
* The *interpreter/JIT compiler* `lli`, which directly executes its bitcode file
  argument, using a Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler.
* The *static compiler* `llc`, which translates the file to a native assembler
  file for any of the supported architectures. It can also produce native object
  files using the flag `-filetype=obj`
* The *analyzer/optimizer* `opt`, which can perform a wide range of code
  optimizations of bitcode.

Note that some installations of LLVM require a version number after the tool
name, for example `llvm-as-3.8` instead of `llvm-as`.

Here are the steps you can use to produce an executable file from within your
compiler:

* Your compiler produces an LLVM file, let's call it `prog.ll`.
* Convert the file to bitcode format using `llvm-as`. For our example file,
  issue the command `llvm-as prog.ll`. This produces the file `prog.bc`.
* Link the bitcode file with the runtime file using `llvm-link`. This step
  requires that you give the name of the output file using the `-o` flag. For
  example we can name the output file `main.bc` like so: `llvm-link prog.bc
  runtime.bc -o main.bc`.
* Generate a native object file using `llc`. By default `llc` will produce
  assembler output, but by using the flag `-filetype=obj` it will produce an
  object file. The invocation will look like this: `llc -filetype=obj main.bc`
* Produce an executable. The LLVM toolchain does not have support for this. The
  easiest way to produce an executable from an object file is to invoke a C
  compiler, like so: `gcc main.o`. This will produce the executable file
  `a.out`. If you want to change the name of the output, use the flag `-o`.
    
    Under the hood `gcc` calls the native linker `ld` but we do not recommend
    that you do that, because it requires specifying extra libraries and
    possibly adding paths. GCC solves all that for us. If you want to see how
    GCC invokes the `ld` command use the `-v` flag when running GCC.


Optimizations
-------------

To wet your appetite, let us see how the LLVM code can be optimized:

```
> cat myfile.ll | llvm-as | opt -std-compile-opts | llvm-dis
```

```llvm
declare void @printInt(i32)

define i32 @main() {
entry:
	tail call void @printInt(i32 5040)
	ret i32 0
}

define i32 @fact(i32 %__p__n) nounwind readnone {
entry:
	%t23 = icmp slt i32 %__p__n, 1	
	br i1 %t23, label %lab2, label %lab1

lab1:	
	%indvar = phi i32 [ 0, %entry ], [ %i.01, %lab1 ]
	%r.02 = phi i32 [ 1, %entry ], [ %t5, %lab1 ]	
	%i.01 = add i32 %indvar, 1		
	%t5 = mul i32 %r.02, %i.01		
	%t7 = add i32 %indvar, 2		
	%t2 = icmp sgt i32 %t7, %__p__n		
	br i1 %t2, label %lab2, label %lab1

lab2:	
	%r.0.lcssa = phi i32 [ 1, %entry ], [ %t5, %lab1 ]
	ret i32 %r.0.lcssa
}
```

The first line above is the Unix command to do the optimization. We `cat` the
LLVM assembly code file and pipe it through the assembler, the optimizer and the
disassembler. The result is an optimized file, where we observe:

* In `main`, the call `fact(7)` has been completely computed to the result
  `5040`. The function `fact` is not necessary anymore, but remains, since we
  have not declared that `fact` is local to this file (one could do that).
* The definition of `fact` has been considerably optimized. In particular, there
  is no more any use of memory; the whole computation takes place in registers. 
* We will explain the `phi` instruction in the lectures; the effect of the first
  instruction is that the value of `%indvar` will be 0 if control comes to
  `%lab1` from the block labelled `%entry` (i.e. the first time) and the value
  will be the value of `%i.01` if control comes from the block labelled `%lab1`
  (i.e. all other times). The `phi` instruction makes it possible to enforce the
  SSA form; there is only one assignment in the text to `%indvar`.

If we save the optimized code in `myfileOpt.bc` (without disassembling it), we
can link it together with the runtime using:

```
> llvm-link myfileOpt.bc runtime.bc -o a.out.bc
```

If we disassemble the resulting file `a.out.bc`, we get (we have edited the file
slightly in inessential ways):

```llvm
@fstr = internal constant [4 x i8] c"%d\0A\00"

define i32 @main() nounwind {
entry:
        %t0 = getelementptr [4 x i8]* @fstr, i32 0, i32 0
        %t1 = call i32 (i8*, ...)* @printf(i8* %t0, i32 5040) nounwind
        ret i32 0
}

declare i32 @printf(i8*, ...) nounwind
```

What remains is a definition of the format string `@fstr` as a global constant
(`\0A` is `\\n`), the `getelementpointer` instruction that returns a pointer to
the beginning of the format string and a call to `printf` with the result value.
Note that the call to `printInt` has been inlined, i.e., replaced by a call to
`printf`; so linking includes optimizations across files.

We can now run `a.out.bc` using the just-in-time compiler `lli`. Or, if we
prefer, we can produce native assembly code with `llc`. On a x86 machine, this
gives

``` 
        .text
        .align  4,0x90
        .globl  _main
_main:
        subl    $$12, %esp
        movl    $$5040, 4(%esp)
        movl    $$_fstr, (%esp)
        call    _printf
        xorl    %eax, %eax
        addl    $$12, %esp
        ret
        .cstring
_fstr:                          ## fstr
        .asciz  "%d\n"
```

<a name="extension_hints"></a>

Hints for the extensions
========================

One-dimensional arrays
----------------------

To implement this extension, the expression `new int[e]` will need to allocate
memory on the heap for the array itself and for the length attribute. Further,
the array elements must be accessed by indexing.

LLVM provides support for built-in arrays, but these are not automatically
heap-allocated. Instead, explicit pointers must be used. Thus, an array will
have the LLVM type `{i32, [0 x t] *}`, where `t` is the LLVM type of the
elements. The first `i32` component holds the length; the second the array
elements themselves. The number of elements in the array is here indicated to
be 0; it is thus your responsibility to make sure to allocate enough memory. For
memory allocation you should use the C function `calloc`, which initializes
allocated memory to 0. You must add a type declaration for `calloc`, but you do
not need to worry about it at link time; LLVM:s linker includes `stdlib`. 

Indexing uses the `getelementptr` instruction, which is discussed in detail in
the lectures.

The LLVM does not include a runtime system with garbage collection. Thus, this
extension should really include some means for reclaiming heap memory that is no
longer needed. The simplest would be to add a statement form `free(a)`, where
`a` is an array variable. This would be straightforward to implement, but is
*not* necessary to get the credit. 

More challenging would be to add automatic garbage collection. LLVM offers some
support for this. If you are interested in doing this, we are willing to give
further credits for that task. 


Multidimensional arrays
-----------------------

This extension involves more work than the previous one. In particular, you must
understand the `getelementpointer` instruction fully and you must generate code
to iteratively allocate heap memory for subarrays.


Structures and object-orientation.
----------------------------------

Techniques to do these extensions are discussed in the lectures. 

From an implementation point of view, we recommend that you start with the
extension with pointers and structures. You can then reuse much of the machinery
developed to implement also the first OO extension. In fact, one attractive way
to implement the object extension is by doing a source language translation to
Javalette with pointers and structures.

The full OO extension requires more sophisticated techniques, to properly deal
with dynamic dispatch.


Native code generation
----------------------

The starting point for this extension could be your LLVM code, but you could
also start directly from the abstract syntax. Of course, within the scope of
this course you will not be able to produce a code generator that can compete
with `llc`, but it may anyhow be rewarding to do also this final piece of the
compiler yourself.

One major addition here is to handle function calls properly. Unlike LLVM (or
the Java virtual machine (JVM), which provides some support for function calls,
you will now have to handle all the machinery with activation records, calling
conventions, and jumping to the proper code before and after the call.

There are several assemblers for x86 available and even different syntax
versions. We recommend that you use the NASM assembler and that you read Paul
Carter's PC assembly [tutorial](/resources#documentation) before you start the
project, unless you are already familiar with x86 architecture. We do not have
strong requirements on code quality for your code generator; straightforward
code generation is acceptable. In particular, you do not need to implement
register allocation to improve your code. This will also have serious negative
consequences for the performance of your code. Indeed, a preferrable way to get
native code is to use a framework like LLVM, which provides an extensive
infrastructure for code manipulation.

An introduction to x86 assembler will be given in the lectures.


<a name="submission_format"></a>

Submission format
=================

1. You prepare your submission by creating a new empty directory, subsequently
   called the `root` directory. In this directory you create three
   subdirectories: `doc`, `lib` and `src`.
2. The `root` directory must, after building as below, contain the executable
   compiler `jlc`. The compiler is used as follows:
    * For submission B and C, the command `jlc myFile.jl` produces the
      executable file `a.out`. Your code will generate a `myFile.ll`, which is
      stored in the *same directory* as the `.jl` source file. Then your
      compiler will call `llvm-as` and `llvm-link` to assemble and link.
    * Optionally, if you have chosen to implement a native code generator, the
      executable is `jlc_ARCH`, where `ARCH` is a CPU architecture such as x86.
      The command `jlc_ARCH myFile.jl` should produce an assembly file
      `myFile.s` and an executable file `a.out`.
    The compiler may be a shell script that calls files in `src`, or a symbolic
    link.
3. The subdirectory `src` must contain all necessary source code. In this
   directory, one should be able to build your compiler using `make`. Thus the
   directory contains:
    * The BNF Converter source file, if the tool has been used.
    * Alex/Lex/JLex and Happy/Yacc/Cup source files.
    * Program modules: abstract syntax, lexer, parser, type checker, code
      generator, top level program.
    * A `Makefile` for building the compiler from source. Note that the
      `Makefile` may also be located in the root directory. The `Makefile`
      should at least have these targets: 
        * A default target (the one that is run when the command `make` is
          issued. This target should compile all source files in the compiler,
          and any runtime library files. It does not need to regenerate any
          source files generated by BNFC, or by any of the parser and lexer
          generators. After running `make` in the source directory, the compiler
          in the root directory should work without further actions from the
          user.
        * A `clean` target that removes all files produced during building.

    Note that `src` should **not** contain obsolete files, such as backup files,
    bitcode files or other unnecessary files.

3. In the `lib` directory you place the following files, as needed:
    * For submission B, you place here [`runtime.ll`](/files/runtime.ll) and
      have the `Makefile` generate `runtime.bc` from it; an LLVM bitcode file
      with the same functions. The file `runtime.ll` can be downloaded from the
      course website.
    * If you choose to do a native code generator for submission C, you place a
      file `runtime.c` here and have the `Makefile` generate the corresponding
      `runtime.o`.
4. The `doc` directory must contain one file in html, ps, plain ascii, or pdf
   format (proprietary formats not allowed), with the following content:
    * An explanation of how the compiler is used (what options, what output,
      etc)
    * A specification of the Javalette language (if produced by BNF converter,
      you may just refer to your BNFC source file).
    * A list of shift/reduce conficts in your parser, if you have such
      conflicts, and an analysis of them.
    * For submission C, an explicit list of extensions implemented.
    * If applicable, a list of features *not* implemented and the reason why.
5. If your compiler `jlc` is a shell script, you should also place this file
   here before building the tar ball.
6. When you have prepared everything, you create a compressed tar ball:
    
    ```
    > tar -czf partA-1.tar.gz doc lib src
    ```
    
    This produces the file `partA-1.tar.gz` that you upload to Fire.  We suggest
    the naming scheme `partX-Y.tar.gz` where X is A, B or C and Y is your
    version number (Y=1 the first time you submit, and if your submission is
    rejected and you must resubmit, the next has Y=2, etc).
    
    If you prefer, you may compress with `bzip2` instead of `gzip`.


Testing your submission
-----------------------

Your submission must be structured as specified in [the section on
testing](#testing). We suggest that, after having prepared your tarball, you
run

```
> runghc Grade.hs /tmp/partA-1.tar.gz
```

The grading program will extract the content extracting and build your compiler,
before running the test suite. This is how we test your submission, so you can
check that building succeeds before you submit. Don't forget to run the tester
with the apprioriate backend and extension flag for submissions B and C.
