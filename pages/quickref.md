The Quickref Menu
=================

This page demonstrates the use of the **quick reference sidebar**.
If your course website contains some large document, such as a large project
description, you may want to add an extra menu, in addition to the normal,
left-hand submenu, to help students navigate it.

In the Compiler Construction course, we have used this capability to make an
easily browsable quick reference guide to the language the students have to
create a compiler for.

<div class="quickref">
Quick reference
---------------
* [Example entry](#example_entry)
* [Another example](#example2)
* [Example with sublist](#sublist_example)
    * [Subitem I](#subitem1)
    * [Subitem II](#subitem2)
</div>


<a name="example_entry"></a>

Example entry
-------------

This entry is completely pointless.
Its only purpose is to waste a bit of space.

And also, to point out that this page has both a submenu on the left, and the
quickref bar on the right.
The quickref bar is not displayed on mobile devices though, as it would
obscure a major part of the page's actual content.


<a name="example2"></a>

Second example entry
--------------------

Wasting space on pointless text is generally not a good thing.
Please avoid doing this on your course website.

However, keeping a decent amount of vertical whitespace keeps your large documents
from becoming massive walls of text.


<a name="sublist_example"></a>

Example using sublists
----------------------

As you can see, you can have submenus in the quickref bar.
This is super useful when you need to navigate, say, a language definition
and want to be able to quickjump to both the section on type, and the
subsection corresponding to each individual type.

* <a name="subitem1"></a>
  **The first subitem**
  This demonstrates that you can use anchors and the quickref bar to jump into
  a list of bullet points.
* <a name="subitem2"></a>
  **The second subitem**
  However, there is no special connection between submenu items and lists.
