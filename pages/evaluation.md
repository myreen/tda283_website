Midterm meeting notes from 2017
-------------------------------

On the 26th of April 2017 we have had the midterm meeting. The following points
were brought up during the meeting:

- Compared to the PLT course, this course offers less guidance.
- Having this course as a project course is appreciated.
- Nice that the ambition level can be decided during the run of the course.
- The testsuite is valued, it helps with the development of the compiler, and even
  gives an indication of the gathered points.
- The testsuite could be extended to check for a correct directory structure.
- Improve the testsuite such that zipped archives are also supported.
- Although not many people make use of the office hours, it is good to keep them
  anyway.
- The workload is fair.
- The project description is clear.
- The lectures work really well; there is a lot of interactivity and plenty of
  room for questions.
